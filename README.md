# TSafety Directory

## Description

TSafety Directory is a mobile-first app designed for transgender & gender-non-conforming individuals, with a secondary focus on privacy & semi-anonymity.

When visiting the site without an account, users can see posts listing medical providers by name, location, and specialty.

Users who make an account can access additional features:
- adding & deleting reviews of providers
- submit a new provider entry

The purpose of this hidden content is to prevent accusations of slander, by restricting the addition of personal reviews to users-only, and tagging reviews with the username of the writer, which must be unique.

### Adding New Providers:

<!-- When entering a new provider, the required fields are 'Provider Name', 'Type', and 'Location'.  After filling these out, the user clicks 'Submit' to add them to the provider database.  The user's newly submitted entry will appear first in the list of provider cards, upon page refresh.

Duplicate providers are not allowed; should the user submit a double entry, or a provider already listed, upon submission their post will not appear.

Upons submission, the page will refresh; if you did not include a name, the post will not appear or be added to the database.
